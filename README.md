- ⚡ Fun fact: I can throw balls very hard or fast, but what is the right think to say ? do you throw a ball hard because the force that comes with that throw is generating power that can be in definition hard or is it fast because the object is travelling fast, that question is something that fills my mind right now... and then again why does it matter
